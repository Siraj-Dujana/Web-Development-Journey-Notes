
if nodemon key word is not recognized in the terminal:
npx nodemon yourFile.js
npx nodemon yourFile.js runs nodemon without installing it globally.
npx executes a package from node_modules or downloads it temporarily.
nodemon auto-restarts your app (yourFile.js) when code changes.


if nodemon is not recognized when you install it as a global.
1. Install Nodemon globally (if not installed):
npm install -g nodemon

2. Add nodemon to PATH:
Go to Control Panel > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables.
Edit the Path variable and add:

C:\Users\Super Galaxy\npm-global\bin

3. Restart Command Prompt/PowerShell and run:

nodemon -v


If you donâ€™t want to install globally, you can use:
npx nodemon
