to use npm:

Option 1: Temporarily Allow Scripts (Recommended)
Run this in VS Code terminal (PowerShell) before running npm commands:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

Option 2: Permanently Allow Scripts
If you want a permanent fix, run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
